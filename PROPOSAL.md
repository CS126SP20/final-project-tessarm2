# [Lil RPG]

    For the final project I would like to make the begining of an RPG (think Pokemon or Final Fantasy). 
    This would be moving around an overworld, interacting with objects/people, and a 
    turn-based battle system. Damage would be handled as in D&D and include random ints added 
    to modify an attack stat for damage. The player would have the option to attack, heal, or flee.
    Like a retro-style game, the player would only be able to navigate with the arrow-keys and have
    a button on the keyboard dedicated to selecting options.

    I have plenty of background on these types of games! Thanks to my older siblings, I have
     been playing/watching games for most of my life, though they were mostly Nintendo. I know 
     the ins and outs of a good RPG. I would love some experience writing a game engine, and getting
      a good feel for the work that goes into game developement. One of the reasons I am interested 
      in pursuing CS is to get a job in the gaming or graphics industry, so I feel like
       this would be a good start.
    
    We had some experience earlier in the semester keeping track of rooms with Amazing Adventure, 
    so I am confident I can translate that to c++. The hard part will be animating and keeping 
    track of items and menus on the screen. To help with that I would use po-spritesheet, which is 
    a CinderBlock that handles spritesheet animation. (https://github.com/Potion/Cinder-poSpritesheet)
    While that handles animation, I would like to challange myself in keeping track of object
    collision, menus, and textboxes. 
    
    I think the first week working on the project would go towards setting up a game engine. The 
    gameplay classes would be for Items, Walls, Rooms(?), Enemies, and the Player. I would then 
    focus on UI classes like textboxes, menus, and selection boxes. Once those can all be created
     and interacted with, I should be at week 2. This would be spent making the opening cutscene 
     with the above classes, and desinging the overworld and generating it in the game window. 
     Week 3 would be spent making it so the user can interact with objects in the world and 
     making sure the battle system works.
    
    If I finished earlier, I would like to spend more time on the visual aspect of the game and 
    try using adding more unique sprite animations. I would also like to  implement more specific 
    sound files, like footsteps and menu noises (clicks and hovers, etc). It would overall be time spent 
    fine-tuning the created level.
