# [Lil RPG]


Hello, this is a short game demo. To navigate, use the arrow-keys. To interact with 
objects on the screen and select text, use the 'z' key. Try walking around
a bit to experience the scrolling background. You are welcome to integrate the
NPC and fight system into your own project. Look into my_app.cc for examples of 
how to use fight.cc and NPC.cc
