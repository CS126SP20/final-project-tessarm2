Hello, this is a short game demo. To navigate, use the arrow-keys. To interact with 
objects on the screen and select text, use the 'z' key. Try walking around
a bit to experience the scrolling background.
To use, open the project in CLion and set your target to cinder-myapp and click the green
play button. If the executable is not showing up, try reloading the CMakeLists.txt
under apps.
